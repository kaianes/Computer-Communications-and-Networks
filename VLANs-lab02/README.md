# Virtual Local Area Networks

Recap of Week 1 :)
• Switches operate as Layer 2 devices, while routers function as Layer 3
devices.
• Switches forward packets based on MAC addresses, whereas routers make
routing decisions using IP addresses.
• Devices connected to a switch can communicate directly with one another
under the condition that they belong to the same network.
• This means their Network IDs must match for communication to occur.
